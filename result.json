From the very beginning they were detailed and clear in their communication, suggested solutions that saved us money and also made sense, and handled all aspects of the job from contracting with other companies to permits and inspections with absolute professionalism and thoroughness. We had full confidence that they were on our side, and they made what was a completely unexpected and complicated problem solvable. We are thrilled with their work, their expertise, and their outstanding customer focus. We would gladly hire them again for any home improvement or repair issues, and recommend them wholeheartedly!",

That same day I went onto houzz.com looking for a contractor that could do renovations on my kitchen and painting of my entire house. I received two recommendations and Massey\u2019s Painting & Home Improvement was one. I reached out to the two recommendations and Cliff called me within 30 mins of me pressing the button for a consultation. He was at my home within 2 hours with his crew to asset the job. I was so impress with his professionalism and out right knowledge of the job I hired him on the spot. He walked me through budgeting as well as he referred me to a lot of vendors to get my materials which were all affordable. The next week Cliff had his crew at my home to begin the work. I can honestly say Cliff picks the best team to work with. Jose and his crew were fantastic at getting the job done. During my renovation process I had an issue with by basement flooding, Cliff instantly referred me to his business partner and within a couple of days I had no more flooding. I received so many complaints on my home as it looked like a whole different house.  I will definitely recommend Massey\u2019s Painting & Home Improvement to anyone in need of painting or home improvement needs.",

It damaged a portion of the roof, some of the siding and almost half of the deck. All of these repairs were completed by Dusti and his team, and they did a wonderful job! My only regret is that I did not have them replace the entire deck. Although my deck was only a few years old at the time it was damaged, the craftsmanship that Veterans provides is so far above what I have received from my former contractors that I will never use anyone else ever again. I definitely would recommend reaching out to them for any size project that you have. I plan to one day have my \"forever home\" built and I will have Veterans Home Remodeling turn my dreams into reality.",

We planned two phases, beginning first with the complete kitchen gut and remodel, leveling the floor to an enclosed addition which opened up to the kitchen, removing walls to and entry/ living/stairway to create more light and an open concept in our 1957 split level ranch.  Beautiful cabinets, room divider and bannister created by Jim's carpenter/artisan from gorgeous live-edge walnut. Jim also reconfigured 3 bedrooms to create a walk-in closets for the master and larger closets for the other bedrooms making the house more efficient and updated to twenty-first century use and function. In the second phase, he created a movie/exercise room and additional bedroom in our unfinished basement with tray ceiling, and sound insulation. Works great!  Jim was very easy to work and communicate with and the work was professional and of great quality!  We would highly recommend Jim for residential renovations!",

The layouts emphasized open living, convenience, and bright spaces. The design themes and choices were thoughtful and artfully realized, and it was clear that Jay emphasizes high-quality, solid construction.\n \nThe house we chose was unfinished, and Jay went out of his way to work with us to get it to the move-in stage as fast as possible and on our schedule. Likewise, he worked with us to address the inevitable growing pain issues with new construction several months after purchasing the home.

Next we review the building plans to advise on equipment location, especially within a basement with the goal of consolidating equipment to accommodate existing or future plans for finished spaces, locate basement windows and doors to maximize sunlight and to match the topography of the property, suggest architectural changes and refinements and finally review all site improvements (decks, patios, outdoor fireplaces and pits, walkways, driveways, et cetera) considered and incorporate them into the site plan and permit process.\r\n\r\nFinally we conclude with a detailed interview to capture all features, options and changes so each client will have a complete package of all requirements and desires contemplated. This information is incorporated into a detailed standard feature and specifications description and is used as the guiding document from which to construct.

Our only prior experience with renovations had been several kitchen remodels. We had no real understanding of what a major, whole-house renovation would entail. We knew we would need knowledgeable, experienced, proven professionals to guide us, and we were so fortunate to have found exactly the right team: Purple Cherry Architects and Bayview Builders.\r\n\r\nIt was Cathy Purple Cherry who introduced us to Bayview, and after meeting with Dave Carlisle and his team and seeing their work, we were sold. We liked the fact that they specialized in waterfront properties, came highly recommended by our architect, had good relationships with high-quality subcontractors, and offered an online \u201cdashboard\u201d to provide full transparency on every aspect of the job.\r\n\r\nWe had regular meetings with the Bayview team, both onsite and in their office, to review progress and discuss any concerns. The entire team was extremely professional and clearly dedicated to ensuring our complete satisfaction with our new home. Whenever we had a question, we got a prompt, complete and easy-to-understand answer either from Chad Dowling, our construction manager, or from Dave Carlisle directly. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, when their team had questions about our preferences or other matters, they were quick to get our thoughts and keep construction moving forward.\r\n\r\nAny project the size and scope of ours inevitably requires change orders as it moves from drawings to reality, and Bayview\u2019s tracking system was extremely helpful when we made these changes. We were able to review it online, see the impact on the budget and schedule, and sign off electronically. This type of efficiency really helped to keep the project moving. In addition, it provided a record of every single transaction that went into the creation of our house, including the cost of all subcontractor services and all materials.\r\n\r\nThroughout the process, Bayview continually stood behind the quality of its work and the work of its subcontractors and made sure we were completely satisfied with every aspect of the house \u2013 even going so far as re-working several items at their own expense.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we are thrilled with our new home. It is everything we imagined and more. Dave, Chad and the entire Bayview team became more than our builders, they were our partners in turning a dream into reality. We couldn\u2019t be happier with the home or our experience building it.\r\nWe were so happy, in fact, we are continuing our relationship with Bayview, using their services to maintain our home. \r\n\r\nIn short, Bayview Builders is a talented, professional team led by an honest, knowledgeable, experienced and fair-minded leader \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get much better!",

He did it all, from permit to certificate of occupancy. He is very nice to work with and followed through on everything. He went the extra mile, when he installed the LED lighting and all of the electrical beyond my expectations. He finished on Budget and schedule despite weather hold-ups.  He matched the house and shed beautifully, as well. Thanks Jesse. (We are already discussing a possible new project.)

They were also great about communicating with our architect and working through details of each part of the project before jumping in.  Everyone worked very hard to stick to the schedule and to get our family of five back into our house as soon as possible.  And Darren was really great about actually finishing up every detail of the project--no items left dangling on the punchlist for months.  He also followed up to make sure everything was working as it should and that we were happy with the project.

                "body": "Kathy Tufts is a talented designer. I hired her several years ago and she was wonderful. Because of her talent she was my choice for remodeling a bathroom. This is a list of went wrong during the construction:\n\nA.Toilet and tub are wrong color and the bathtub is the shorter than the previous bathtub.  I requested a bright white toilet and tub multiple times. Also, the bathtub it is not level after installation. \n\nB.A mosaic made of \u00bc inch glass tiles was not competently installed and the mosaic and the side walls\u2019 \u00bc inch glass tiles do not reach the ceiling as planned. The bathtub before the remodel was higher and the measurements for the mosaic and side walls tile were taken from it. The tile goes to varying heights on the walls. Where the side wall tiles and the mosaic meet at the corners of the walls there is more space than there should be. The workers tried to fill in the spaces where the mosaic was too short or not wide enough but the pattern/colors of the tile do not match the pattern of the mosaic. The white thin set shows significantly between some of the seams where the six pieces of the mosaic were joined. The thin set will need to be picked out before being grouted because grout will not cover the thin set since the tiles are so small and there is not enough space between the face and the back of the 1/4 inch tiles.\n\nC.The bathroom vanity came with the drawers on the right side and the door of the cabinet on the left side instead of the other way around. The plumbing had to be moved to fit the configuration of the new cabinet as the previous cabinet was the opposite configuration.\n\nD.The marble top of the vanity has one hole for the faucet instead of the Moen Banbury three holed faucet that was purchased.\n\nE.The Moen Banbury bathtub hardware set came with plumbing valve. The valve is in the box while the wallboard and glass tiles have already been installed. The fixtures were available at the start of the remodel.\n\nSince I know next to nothing about construction I hired a remodeling company to evaluate the work and write a report. Also, a neighbor who is a carpenter and former home inspector looked at the project along with a handyman I use. I contacted the mosaic company and I found a mosaic expert through a tile shop who came to look at the mosaic. They each contributed to the list. The mosaic company, the remodeling company and the mosaic installer agreed the mosaic needs to be demolished and redone by an experienced installer because it is very difficult to repair the mosaic.\n\nThe project is not complete.",

                "body": "DiMarco and Associates did a total remodel of my kitchen, from the floor up. Matthew is so knowledgeable about all aspects of design and construction. He came up with ideas and suggestions which made a lot of sense. Once he saw the space he saw no reason to change the footprint, it is a small space and I did not want to have to move gas and water lines. We had not planned on replacing the wood floor in the kitchen, but once the old appliances were removed we saw the need to replace it which right away put the project behind schedule and a bit over budget, again, Matthew found flooring which would blend really well with the granite and back splash, despite this, the delivery date was met.\r\n\r\nIt was truly a joy to work with Matthew and Tony Di Marco, I really can't say enough good things about them. True professionals. I highly recommend them to anyone entertaining remodeling. They put me totally at ease with the stress of remodeling by answering every question and being flexible, and above all, keeping all lines of communication open from the very first meeting to the delivery of the project and beyond.",

The previous owners had hardwood flooring and ceramic tile. Unfortunately, the ceramic tile was damaged, and given the age of the home, we couldn't find wood flooring that would match the existing floors after removing the tile. We needed some professional advice and decided to reach out to Unique Property Investment Group. BEST DECISION EVER!!! The staff was very professional, and they recommended flooring that would accommodate our lifestyle for both children and pets while staying on budget. We are EXTREMELY HAPPY with the end result and would reach out to them again for future projects!",

                "body": "The Contigo Group met our highest expectations. In a few words, the team was courteous, friendly, professional, skilled, resourceful, and efficient. But isn't that what you would expect from your contractor? What else would cause one to select The Contigo Group? Our principal criterion for selection of a contractor to do the minor construction, significant repair, and major painting was \"quality.\" The old 19th Century house was completely gutted, rebuilt inside and out, and painted two years before we purchased the house. But, the original work by another contractor was not completely up to our satisfaction. We selected The Contigo Group because we had seen their beautiful work on a nearby residence and had confidence that they could meet our expectations. There are a few particular characteristics of their work that deserve special note. The lead contractor, Mauricio, has a quick and discerning perspective. He can spot a flaw in the design, construction, installation, or interior decoration in an instant. He showed us that he is an expert in painting, but he also evinced that his expertise covers most everything in a home. That means that he can see what needs to be done, in many cases, even before we identified the work. That was very helpful, because he knew exactly how to fix the issues he or we identified. Thus, he has a particularly keen eye for paint/interior attributes, including colors, texture, surface hardness, clean lines, and overall quality of appearance. Furthermore, The Contigo Group had sufficient resources available to do the work promptly. We had other contractors whom we trusted to do the work, but it was a big job and we were not prepared to have the work extend over many, many weeks. Mauricio delivered sufficient resources to make significant daily progress, but not so many that overwhelmed us as we continued to live in the house during the work period. Another thing about Mauricio's workforce: some of his crew were so highly skilled, that he could trust them with nearly any part of the job. That meant that continual progress wasn't dependent upon his constant presence, supervision, and direction. Work was accomplished quickly. Perhaps most important, Mauricio listens to his customers; he is creative in his solutions; and he is willing to experiment with alternatives to satisfy even the most demanding home owner. We are very satisfied. You will be too.",

I was told I would get a blue vanity and white sink with a faucet I picked, but a gray/black vanity was installed with a speckled sink and countertop. Eventually the sink was replaced with a white one but they would not replace the vanity or paint it. A completely different faucet was also put in. My hall bathroom was to take 8-10 days and it took about a month and had a leak in the sink. My family did not like hearing them yell at their workers in front of them and when there were problems, Gary would only say- call my wife. They were to begin my powder room but seemed to have little interest in doing so because after I called and agreed to proceed even though I was unhappy with the hall bathroom, after 2 weeks I never heard from them. Finally, I asked for my money back. They refunded it without a problem and told me they had a death in their family. They could have texted or emailed me if that were true, like responsible business owners. I was very disappointed, especially after addressing communication concerns I had read about prior to signing my contract. Highly unsatisfied!!!",

After my wife and I purchased a house, we knew there was a lot of remodeling we wanted to complete before moving in. \r\n Shortly after we found Zion Home Remodeling's website and reached out to Antulio, the General Manager, he contacted us to set up a time to visit our home and go over our plans for remodeling.  He provided an extremely detailed quote.  We knew exactly what would be done and at what price.  Antulio's promptness and professionalism, and his clear knowledge of his field, impressed us.\r\n\r\nThe project itself, which involved repainting the entire interior of the house, refinishing the floors, and doing other smaller fixes, couldn't have gone better.  The team was timely, friendly, and extremely hard-working.  It was also the same men every day, which made us feel more comfortable about having contractors accessing the property on a daily basis.  \r\n\r\nAntulio promptly answered all our questions and was very flexible with adding smaller projects in the middle of the remodeling, such as cabinet lighting and some exterior painting.  He also made recommendations about improvements we hadn't considered, such as replacing the antique attic access with a modern folding ladder.  Most importantly, Antulio and his team were understanding when we found little things that needed to be adjusted.  And, best of all, they made themselves available to touchup aspects of the job after we moved in, such as fixing a little paint chipping from the moving company, and so forth.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I highly recommend Zion Home Remodeling.  They do great work at an extremely reasonable rate.  They didn't go over budget and they stayed on schedule completing the project.  Finally, they were responsive and prompt, and trustworthy and friendly.  All highly desired qualities when looking for a contractor!",

I was not informed that some incorrect items were delivered until over 4 weeks later)\n- lack of care towards this project\n- no one from the company was not at the project site/my home to receive the materials that were ordered.\n\nMy project was never completed, but since the site is making me put a completion date in order to post my review, I put the date the contract was cancelled.",

The company's workers arrived at my home on the day promised, respecting my home and worked diligently until the job was done. The kitchen is beautiful and I couldn't be happier.  Everyone who has visited has complimented me on how great the kitchen looks and the wonderful job MSH did.  I will be looking into the next job I would like MSH to do.

A complete remodel of kitchen & family room, addition of large pantry and 18 x 21 ft room over the kitchen (ROK) with full bath.  This was a major makeover and Aspect nailed every \u201caspect\u201d of it!\n \nTheir expert carpenters & installers handled everything in the kitchen, fam rm, pantry & ROK (cabinets, appliances, paint, stain, finish work, etc.) as well as install of 3 windows, 4 ext doors, 2 tons of HVAC, flight of stairs, full bath, and 12 ft combination mantle-countertop made from exotic wood.  Top quality workmanship and absolute accountability are the hallmarks of the Aspect team starting with their contract project manager/owner Ryan Long & Kevin Grimes.\n \nAspect\u2019s ability to succeed goes far beyond their organic expertise.  Their performance as general contractor (GC) was exceptional.  Communications, coordination, sequencing, flexibility, care, expert design advice, trust and efficiency are words that describe Aspect as GC.  This was the most important reason the project was completed on time, on budget, at high quality with almost no rework.\n \nFor any large remodel, we absolutely recommend having a GC and unequivocally recommend Aspect to fill the role.  They ran it all: plumbing, electrical, HVAC, flooring, insulation, sheet rock, paint, supply chain, etc.  You cannot get a better GC than Aspect and you don\u2019t want to do it yourself!\n \nAspect took the beautiful design done by Joni Zimmerman at DSI Solutions and made it happen.  They brought each of these rooms down to the 2x4s and expertly and beautifully put them back together at a very reasonable price!  Aspect is a great team and we could not be happier!!!",

What started out as a bathroom remodel turned into a major renovation once we saw the dedication, hard work, and craftsmanship of EZ Contracting.  On the first day they showed up when expected and treated our home like their own.  They protected the floors with tarps, set up electric tools outside, and even put up with our bossy little dog who was 'supervising' the whole time. Each day they left the project as tidy as possible so we weren't left with exposed electrical wires or other hazards. The expert tile work is truly amazing and is the centerpiece of the new bathroom! We also had them tear out some old tile in the entry way and they perfectly matched hardwood to the existing floor, which was then sanded and refinished with an updated stain, showing no signs of the old tile. Two new exterior doors were replaced, all upstairs walls were expertly repainted, and 10 recessed lights were installed in the living room and dining room to make it look like a new, beautiful home! Every detail was covered, every inch and corner was perfect, the work truly exceeded our expectations! Mr. Ho was a pleasure to work with, having years of experience in this area he was able to offer helpful suggestions and provided us with ideas throughout the process. We would highly recommend EZ Contracting for all your remodeling needs and would happily hire them again for future projects!",

                "body": "In November of 2012 we moved into our now home in Bethesda MD. The process was challenging at times however we worked through many of issues with NDI Homes of MD. In early October of 2013 we had a site visit by NDI owner Tom Lizzo along with a new site manager to address some issues to make sure we could move in by November. One of those issues was the presence of Mold in the garage and a mold/musty smell in the basement. NDI hired a professional to remediate and remove the mold and told us the smell in the basement would eventually go away. In March of 2013 we had our 90 day walk through some general issues along with some open issues from a Site Visit dated 10-23-12. The general issues included some minor repairs, several items that were to be addressed by the subs, and several areas of drywall cracking near the trim and some on a few walls. The drywall items seemed normal considering the settling of the house. The drywall issue was repaired however over the course of the next few months some of the areas of cracking came back along with entire seems of drywall starting to appear in the Master Bathroom and Bedroom. Eight foot sections of the seems of the drywall are visible. We bought this up (in addition to the smell in the basement) in our 11 month walk through and some of the drywall repair was done however the contractor for NDI, Jeff Rock, said he would have to get approval to do the drywall seam repairs. This was in January of 2014. I had never heard back so I contacted Heidi Thomas on May 7, 2014 to which she told me she would have it taken care of and that Jeff Rock would schedule an appointment. I then followed up via email 5 times before I received an answer on June 5, 2014. Heidi said Jeff Rock had been contacted and would reach out to me shortly. On June 20, 2014 I reached out to Jeff Rock myself only to find out he was never told to preform he repairs. I contacted Heidi immediately only to get an answer on June 24, 2014 that Tom Lizzo would not approve the work order until a permit issue was resolved with Montgomery County. During the construction of my home the site conditions called for a large retaining wall that was outsourced to a Great Scapes. NDI site-super Steve Point (who was fired at the completion of my home)told Great Scapes that the wall was permitted and to start construction. On May 11, 2014 I was notified by Montgomery County Department Of Permitting Services that the retaining wall was never permitted. They conducted an investigation and issued NDI Homes a Notice of Violation along with Great Scapes for doing the work. Great Scapes acted on the information from the NDI Site-Super. Montgomery County is requiring either NDI Homes or Great Scapes to go through the permitting process to resolve the case. Of course this has nothing to do with the drywall issues in our home however NDI has refused to honor their commitment and stand by their product not to mention it took 12 emails and 18 voice mails to find this out. Unfortunately the above issue is a minor issue compared to the other outstanding issues we need addressed. I mentioned to NDI that the Hardy Plank on the exterior of the home is at grade level and I learned that there should be a minimum of 6 inches between the grade and the Hardy material. NDI Homes performed the final grade of the house and is refusing to even acknowledge the problem. In addition as mentioned above our basement continues to have a mold/musty smell. We have had several folks look at it including the HVAC company and they find it unusual that it still smells this long after construction. And finally today we found mold in our garage, something that was supposed to be taken care of back in October of 2013. This was the final straw and I have no confidence that NDI will resolve the situation.  I am happy to share my experience in detail to anyone that is considering them - email me at vtohan@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are looking to resolve these issues starting with the most basic and urgent first: 1. Mold in Garage - mold on the wall separating the two garage doors needs to be remediated and repaired along with finding the root cause of its presence. Keep in mind this was an issue NDI acknowledged on the 10-23-12 site visit 2. Mold/musty smell in basement - odor in basement needs to be resolved and root cause needs to be determined. Also an issue from 10-23-12 site visit 3. Drywall Issues - the evidence of seams coming apart in the Master Bedroom and Bathroom is clearly an issue of sub-standard workmenship and was identified to NDI within the 12 month home warranty. In addition I have email correspondence confirming that contractor was scheduled however NDI had no intention of fixing. 4. Final Grade - grade level is touching the Hardy Plank material. I confirmed with manufacture and Montgomery County that there should be 6 inches between grade and material. This needs to be addressed. 5. Permit for Retaining wall - Site-super coordinated the entire construction of the wall (I have several emails that I sent to the county) and claimed that it was permitted. Based on that Great Scapes preformed the work. Site-Super fired after the completion of the house for many situations just like this one. NDI needs to obtain permit and have Montgomery County close the case.",

Very helpful for finalizing colors and wall finishes!  And I like that Gust picks up the paint for you - one less errand to do!  \r\n\r\nHe painted 3 rooms in half a day!  I wasn't sure about one of the colors and Michael told me to give it some time but call if I wanted to change it.  Glad I did because I love it now!  That day he took great pride in his work and rightfully so.  My small DC apartment looks absolutely fabulous!  \r\n\r\nGreat service, pricing, and quality.\r\n\r\n*Also posted on Yelp.com",

They transformed my 1989 bathroom, which was an old and inefficient (it was leaking down into my kitchen), into a space that I keep walking into just to look at and smile. I feel like my bathroom can be showcased on HGT!. They are meticulous and they pay tremendous attention to details. As well, they are humble, easy to work with and extremely professional. They entertained alllllll of my questions and accommodated my last minute requests. They were on time every day and communicated well. They met their construction timeline, even with the Christmas holidays cutting into a few days. Their pricing was fair. I will definitely use them again and have already referred them to my close friends. You often hear horror stories about shoddy work and disappearing contractors. It is more than a breath of fresh air to meet an honorable and dependable construction team whose work will last for a very long time. I recommend them with absolutely no reservations.

His expertise at drywall was evident and the tiler did a wonderful job adding a new shower floor, widening the shower, adding a recessed area for shampoo and matching the glass block accents. We kept adding ideas and he put in a window to the outside which let in more light and we love the whole look.",
